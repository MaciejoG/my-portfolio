        <!-- Section description -->
        <p class="lead grey-text text-justify w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">Land2Plant is a startup I have co-founded together with my four colleagues from studies. We aim to create an international crowdfunding platform, which connects land-owners who want to rent out their properties with citizens who want to invest in a safe and sustainable way. The startup has won several prizes and has been part of several startup incubators. It was an entrepreneurship journey which has taught me more than any business course can. Tons of invested hours, rewarded with business, marketing, finance, law and communication skills one can't simply learn at school.</p>

            <h5 class="font-weight-bold my-4">The Deal</h5>
            <p class="grey-text mb-md-0 mb-0">Throughout the project we learned techniques how to develop simple yet attractive business plans. Our plan was based on a platform model, in which Land2Plant engages with two main stakeholders: landowners and investors (the crowd):
              <li class="grey-text">landowners provide land, investors providide capital,</li>
              <li class="grey-text">Land2Plant investigates project proposals, chooses the most suitable land, designs the power plant and manages the build,</li>
              <li class="grey-text">Investors receive up to 7% ROI,</li>
              <li class="grey-text">Landowners receive part of the money generated from energy sells,</li>
              <li class="grey-text">Land2Plant charges up to 20% comissions fee at the start of the project.</li>

              <li class="grey-text">I have led a team of 4, ensuring everyone is working on items accordingly with individual skills, mitigating conflicts, leading weekly team meetings and communicating with external stakeholders,</li>

            <p class="grey-text mb-md-0 mb-4">I developed a robust financial plan, with financial projection for the nearest years. The plan was based on a realistic upscaling plan for our power plants, as well as on assumptions for the annual invested capital. These were determined through an exhaustive benchmarking of our competitors. Naturally, we have also included all fixed and variable expanses. The key challanges which we overcame:
              <li class="grey-text">making a thorough market research,</li>
              <li class="grey-text">getting familiar with fixed and variable costs for a young bussiness,</li>
              <li class="grey-text">estimating costs of permits and legal help,</li>

              <li class="grey-text">we performed competitors analysis,</li>

            <p class="grey-text mb-md-0 mb-0">Our startup has won multiple awards. The journey began by winning the 3rd place at the european finals of EDPR University Challange 2019, having been selected by EDPR Renewables from over 100 ideas. We were then selected to pitch during the global finals. We also achieved the 1st place on the polish EPAE Conferense in the startups cathegory. Then, we were awarded 2nd place during Entreprenourship Journey organized by EIT Innoenergy. Each of these event has taught us how to better communicate bussiness and technical ideas to investors. We mastered out pitching and networking skills, both of which I consider important in daily life.
