        <p class="lead grey-text text-justify w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">
            Ever wondered what happens with the water you use when showering? It is being removed to the sink, despite having a relatively high temperature. Isn't that a loss of energy we already paidÂ for? Well, that's what we also found out at Empa - Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. We aimed to make use of that energy by extracting heat from grey water produced at residential buildings. In this project, my role was to make a computer simulation of the innovative heating system and to compare its performance to the one without the heat-recovery system equipped. This gave us indication of the potential benefits before we build the prototype. I have created a thermal model of the system, programmed the model in Matlab, and created a time-series prediction of temperatures inside and outside of the building. The model is based on real weather and ground data for Switzerland, as well as statistical data for residential buildings and water consumption.

            <p class="grey-text mb-md-0 mb-0">
                The system is based on heat recovery from grey water produced in the bathroom and kitchen. Used water comes down the pipes and goes through a heat-exchanger. Part of its heat is being removed and transferred to cold water coming from the fresh-water supply. As the cold water gets warmer, it is being stored in a hot water tank. The tank reduces the costs of water heating as well as provides a natural heater for the room. For example, it can be placed in the basement and keep its temperature high, thus reducing the costs of heating for the entire building.

            <p class="grey-text mb-md-0 mb-0">
              The time-series simulation shows distribution of temperatures at various rooms over one year, as the result of heat and mass transfer being calculated by the thermal model. Long simulation time ensures that the effects of heat recovery are not narrowed down to initial benefits. The simulation is based on read lata for ground temperature and weather in Switzerland. The system compares both systems with and without grey water heat recovery. The results indicate that the system can substantially benefit from the upgrade, as the room temperature increases by roughly 5 C degrees over the entire year.
